  <p>Greetings Civic Maintenance Crew—</p>
  <p>It’s almost here.</p>
  <p>Tonight, we’re releasing the full Deregulation Submission Toolkit—a collection of sample entries, agency contacts, regulatory citations, and plain-English justifications you can use to push back on the systems that protect privilege, not people.</p>
  <p>This isn’t performative. It’s paperwork.</p>
  <p>You don’t need a budget. You don’t need government credentials. You don’t even need to be polite (though I will generally recommend it). You just need 10 minutes and a browser.</p>
  <p>The website is live (you’re here!)</p>
  <p>Send it to your group chat. Post it in your Discord. Text it to your uncle who quotes Milton Friedman at Thanksgiving but still asks you to do his TurboTax.</p>
  <p>And if you’re not sure where to start, here are a few sample submissions to peek at.<br>
  <a href="https://www.submitrelentlessly.org/sortable-index">Sample Submissions →</a></p>
  <p>We’ll be updating the Toolkit regularly. Tonight is just the start.</p>
  <p>The best way to fight a bully bigger than you? Let them swing first—then step aside and let gravity finish the job.</p>
  <p>We don’t need to outmuscle the bully. Let’s show up, and let the weight of what they’ve built bring them down.</p>
  <p><strong>Submit the paperwork. Never Yourself.</strong></p>
  <p>—Compliance Liaison, Department of Deregulation</p>
