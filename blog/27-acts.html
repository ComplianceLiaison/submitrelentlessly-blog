  <h1>27 Tiny Acts of Resistance (Each Under 3 Minutes)</h1>
  <p><em>Written by Compliance Liaison · April 30, 2025</em></p>

  <p><strong>Let’s be real—regulatory engagement doesn’t usually make the cut on your afternoon to-do list. But it should.</strong></p>

  <p>Because right now, corporations and lobbyists are flooding the deregulation portals with carefully worded suggestions to dismantle public protections in the name of “efficiency.” And if we don’t push back—clearly, deliberately, and relentlessly—they win by default.</p>

  <p>That’s where the <strong>Operational Toolkit</strong> comes in.</p>

  <p>There are 27 published entries—fully written, formatted, and CFR-cited. All you have to do is copy, paste, and click submit. Each one takes <strong>less than 3 minutes</strong>.</p>

  <p>Doing all 27? That’s under 90 minutes.</p>

  <h3>That’s Less Time Than…</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sitting through a pointless Zoom meeting.</li>
    <li>Finding where that one Google Doc lives.</li>
    <li>Doomscrolling your way into another headache.</li>
    <li>Bingeing one episode of a show you’ll regret starting.</li>
    <li>Congress spends naming a post office.</li>
    <li>One Supreme Court hearing that rewrites your bodily autonomy.</li>
    <li>A corporate webinar on “resilience” during systemic collapse.</li>
    <li>Explaining to your family what your job actually is.</li>
    <li>Most meetings about improving efficiency.</li>
    <li>The time it took for your rights to get rolled back.</li>
    <li>Decoding your company’s internal compliance training while crying into your lukewarm coffee.</li>
    <li>Trying to cancel a subscription you forgot you had.</li>
    <li>A Sunday scroll through Instagram.</li>
    <li>Arguing with a bot on Reddit about late-stage capitalism.</li>
    <li>Making a complicated coffee order and waiting for it.</li>
    <li>Assembling IKEA furniture (and more likely to improve the world).</li>
    <li>Waiting on hold with the IRS, only to get transferred to another queue.</li>
    <li>The rollback of 40 years of environmental protections.</li>
    <li>Figuring out which “final interim revised draft” is actually final.</li>
    <li>A billionaire’s quarterly tax planning session.</li>
    <li>Debating whether you should do something.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Toolkit is built to speak the system’s language—clean, coded, and CFR-linked. These are real submissions, formatted to be accepted by the very bureaucracies we’re trying to hold accountable.</p>

  <p><strong>This is malicious compliance.</strong></p>

  <p>They’re betting we’ll be too tired to act. Joke’s on them—we’re tired AND tactical.</p>

  <p>A few minutes of deliberate action today might be the only thing standing between us and decades of deregulation disguised as “common sense.”</p>

  <p>So take 3 minutes. Then take another. And another. Submit relentlessly.</p>
