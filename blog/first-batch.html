  <h1>First Batch Available</h1>
  <p><em>Written by Compliance Liaison · April 29, 2025</em></p>

  <p>The first wave of deregulation reform proposals is out in the wild.</p>
  <p>This batch covers everything from qualified immunity to corporate personhood to restoring voting rights. It’s a mix of constitutional cleanup, civil rights repair, and common-sense structural fixes—some spicier than others.</p>
  <p>If you spot a typo, a broken citation, or something that doesn’t quite land—let us know.</p>
  <p>While I do genuinely enjoy parsing through the CFR and policy documents as a hobby (yes, I know)—I’m still human. If you've got a solid correction, a smarter framing, or better way to pull a policy lever—bring it.</p>
  <p>That said—this isn’t open mic night for nonsense. It’s controlled demolition of broken systems, with blueprints for what comes next. Clarity, not combat.<br>
  Disruption is the side dish. Direction is the main course.</p>
  <p>This is just the beginning. More submissions are queued up and on the way.</p>
  <p>Also, we want to drop a caveat to all of this—the goal isn’t that everyone agrees 100% on every topic and every proposal. These aren’t final answers, they’re a starting point. A concrete way to think about what needs fixing, what’s broken, and what a better version might look like.</p>
  <p>Unlike most of what passes for political discourse right now, use these as actual starting points for discussion. Open discourse is a wonderful thing when both parties bring facts, context, and curiosity. Not just performative outrage, reactionary talking points, or deeply rooted positions shaped by privilege, control, and indifference to human impact.</p>
  <p>Thanks to everyone who’s followed along so far—whether you’re here for the regulatory nuance or the existential catharsis. I appreciate the notes and quiet solidarity.</p>
  <p>There’s more on the way.</p>
  <p><strong>Submit the paperwork. Never Yourself.</strong></p>
