    <h1>Still Submitting. Still Relentless.</h1>

  <p>Quick update: the web design has (hopefully) stabilized—so now we can finally start plowing through the backlog of deregulation suggestions we’ve been sitting on. We’re still adding new ones daily. Still inviting you to join in.</p>

  <p>If you want to browse the streamlined reforms that are already posted, or if you're more of a PDF-lover—or just like doing things the “hard” way (which is still pretty easy, just involves more clicking)—check out the full toolkit. And if you’ve got ideas of your own, send them our way.</p>

  <p>The goal is to make participation as easy and irresistible as possible.</p>

  <p>And seriously, just check out one of our streamlined submissions. It’s so easy now. Go look! Right now!!</p>

  <p><strong>Copy. Paste. Submit. Repeat.</strong></p>

  <p>Share this with everyone you know.</p>

  <p>The more people we get submitting suggestions, the harder we are to ignore—and the deeper the “paper” trail they’ll have to try to deny later.</p>

  <p>We’re still accepting constructive feedback on the site—we want this process to work for everyone.</p>

  <p>Check back daily. We’re just getting started or sign up for our newsletter below!</p>
