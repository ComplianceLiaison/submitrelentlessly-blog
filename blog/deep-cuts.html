    <h1>New Submissions Just Dropped—And They Cut Deep</h1>

  <p><h2>🧹 Fire the Officials Who Betray the Constitution</h2></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not enough to vote them out. Some appointees obstruct lawful transitions of power.</p>
<p>Some ignore court orders. Some sabotage investigations or suppress urgent warnings.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>And yet—they stay in office. Why? Because the Senior Executive Service (SES) protections that were</p>
<p>designed to insulate federal leadership from political whims now serve as a shield for egregious misconduct.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>📝 <strong><a href="https://www.submitrelentlessly.org/oversight/firethem">Submit: Enable Removal of High-Ranking Officials for Constitutional Violations</a></strong><br></p>
<p>aka—<em>Fire the Deep State Traitors</em><br></p>
<p>This reform adds a narrow exception for expedited removal of SES officials when credible findings show they</p>
<p>violated constitutional duties. It protects whistleblowers and civil servants—and ensures bad actors don’t get a golden parachute.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><h2>💸 Close the Capital Gains Loopholes and Fund Public Care</h2></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Every time you hear “we can’t afford Medicare expansion” or “Medicaid is unsustainable,” remember this:</p>
<p>we spend far more on tax breaks for billionaires than we do on public health.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>📝 <strong><a href="https://www.submitrelentlessly.org/health-care/fund-medicaid">Submit: Close Capital Gains Loopholes to Fund Medicare & Medicaid</a></strong><br></p>
<p>aka—<em>End Bureaucratic Waste in Tax Expenditures</em><br></p>
<p>This proposal eliminates tax timing tricks and carve-outs that let the wealthy defer or avoid paying their fair share.</p>
<p>It doesn’t just raise revenue—it restores fairness, and creates the fiscal space to strengthen the safety net we’re told we can’t afford.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><h2>🚨 Make FEMA Aid Fair Again</h2></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Disaster relief is supposed to be fast, equitable, and needs-based. In reality? FEMA’s discretionary process</p>
<p>favors wealthy zip codes, penalizes renters, and leaves already-marginalized communities in ruin.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>📝 <strong><a href="https://www.submitrelentlessly.org/oversight/femafunding">Submit: Restore Equitable Access to Federal Disaster Relief Funds</a></strong><br></p>
<p>aka—<em>Eliminate FEMA’s Discretionary Red Tape</em><br></p>
<p>This reform cuts the administrative “flexibility” that lets disaster aid mirror redlining maps.</p>
<p>It replaces opaque criteria with clear, equitable distribution rules—and demands accountability for how recovery funds are awarded.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p><h2>📢 Take 3 Minutes. Submit All 3.</h2></p>
<p><p></p>
<p>Every entry is written, cited, and ready to go. All you have to do is copy, paste, and click submit.</p>
<p>These aren’t theoretical reforms. They’re real policy actions the government <em>invited you</em> to propose.</p>
