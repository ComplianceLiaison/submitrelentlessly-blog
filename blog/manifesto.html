  <p><strong>Submit the paperwork. Never yourself.</strong></p>
  <p>We didn‚Äôt set out to build a movement. We set out to find a way to act.</p>
  <p>Too much of what passes for civic engagement today is either performance, delay, or capitulation.</p>
  <p>The structures of governance that once served the public good have been bent into systems of protection‚Äîbut not for the public.</p>
  <p>Waiting for systemic reform has proven to be a failed strategy.</p>
  <p>We are choosing a different path: seize the mechanism itself.</p>

  <h3>Formal Resistance, Malicious Compliance</h3>
  <p>Where others lobby for deregulation to weaken public protections, we file deregulation suggestions that dismantle loopholes built for the elite.</p>
  <p>Where others sabotage systems with apathy or rage, we comply‚Äîmaliciously, relentlessly, formally.</p>
  <p>We do not call for chaos.</p>
  <p>We call for strategic submission‚Äîusing administrative portals, feedback mechanisms, and formal comment periods. The goal is not to erode protections but to reinforce them, and to strip privileges from those who built shields for themselves within the system.</p>

  <h3>Why Compliance is Our Strategy</h3>
  <p>Compliance is inevitable.</p>
  <p>It is demanded by every system that pretends to be democratic while funneling power upward.</p>
  <p>But submission‚Äîreal submission‚Äîis a choice.</p>
  <p>We refuse.</p>
  <p>We submit the paperwork.</p>
  <p>We submit forms, comments, protocols, suggestions.</p>
  <p>We follow the procedures. We check the boxes.</p>
  <p>We meet every technicality.</p>
  <p>And in doing so we break the machine from the inside out.</p>

  <h3>The Future Belongs to Those Who File</h3>
  <p>Change doesn‚Äôt start with a speech or a hashtag.</p>
  <p>It starts with a form.</p>
  <p>Filed properly. Filed relentlessly.</p>
  <p>We are not seeking permission.</p>
  <p>We are seizing the mechanism.</p>
  <p>We are formalizing resistance.</p>
  <p>We are bureaucratic aikido.</p>

  <p><strong>Submit the paperwork.<br>Never yourself.</strong></p>
