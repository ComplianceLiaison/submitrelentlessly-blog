<h3>A Better System Is Possible—And Within Reach</h3>

<p>
They said the system was just broken. That this is how it is. That inequality, debt, burnout—it's just the cost of living free.
</p>

<p>
But here’s the truth:<br><br>
What we’re living through didn’t just happen. It was built this way—on purpose, over decades.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>We Had It—and They Took It</h3>

<ul>
  <li>College was tuition-free (or nearly so)</li>
  <li>One income paid the bills</li>
  <li>Housing wasn’t speculative bloodsport</li>
  <li>We taxed the rich, and used that money to build</li>
  <li>Public schools, science, roads, parks, pensions, and food systems weren’t partisan battlegrounds—they were the point of government</li>
</ul>

<p>
These systems weren’t flawless. But they delivered—and that made them a target.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>When We Started Winning, They Changed the Rules</h3>

<p>
As soon as public investment started closing gaps and helping more people thrive, the ones who had the most to lose from fairness started tearing it down.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tax cuts for the wealthy</li>
  <li>Deregulation in finance, housing, and healthcare</li>
  <li>Privatization of everything from prisons to student loans</li>
  <li>A propaganda machine that taught us to resent each other instead of the people rigging the game</li>
</ul>

<p>
They didn’t shrink government. They just rewired it to serve privilege.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>You’re Not Failing—<u>You’re Being Failed</u></h3>

<p>
You didn’t do anything wrong.<br>
You’re not bad at budgeting, bad at being an adult, or bad at time management.
</p>

<p>
You’re navigating a system designed to extract everything from you—your labor, your time, your health, your future—and call it freedom.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>You Don’t Need Permission to Fight Back</h3>

<p>
You don’t need to be a policy expert to know what’s fair.<br>
You don’t need a law degree to call out what’s broken.<br>
You just need the courage to name what’s unjust—and the will to push back.
</p>

<p>
We make that part easy. Just open a browser tab. Give it 90 seconds. Submit something that matters.
</p>

<p>
Our campaign makes it possible to fight back with bureaucratic precision.<br>
We’re stuffing their deregulation portal with proposals they never expected—ones that dismantle privilege, not protections.

<h3>This system was bent to serve the few.<br><br> 
  <span style="color: #C67728;">But we can fix it—<br><br>
  <span style="color: #631414;">because we outnumber them, we care, and we have the tools to build something better.</span></span>
